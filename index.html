    <p><strong>Seeing Ourselves at the Cross</strong></p><br>
    <p>One of the great dangers when reading the Gospel accounts of Christ’s death is imagining ourselves as observers rather than participants. We read of the disciples, the priests, the rulers, the soldiers, and the crowds, and we instinctively place ourselves at a safe distance. But the cross does not permit spectators. This song presses us to confess with honesty: I was there.</p><br>

    <p>The song teaches us to confess ourselves. And even this confession is mercy, for the ability to see our sin rightly is already a gift of grace.</p><br>

    <p><strong>A Word About the Man on the Cross</strong></p><br>
    <p>The man beside Jesus is given to us not so that we might delay repentance, but so that we might never despair of grace. Scripture records one such example, so that no sinner may say it is too late—but only one, so that no sinner may presume upon tomorrow.</p><br>

    <p>The man’s faith did not save him because it came at the end of life, but because Christ gave him eyes to see, and he responded at once. We are not promised a final hour beside the cross, nor a last moment of clarity. The call of the Gospel is therefore for today: to look to Christ now, to trust Him while He is near, knowing that when He calls us before Himself, it will be as the King we have either trusted or ignored.</p><br>

    <p><strong>A Word of Gospel Call and Perseverance</strong></p><br>
    <p>At this point, the cross confronts us all. To those who do not yet know Christ, the man beside Jesus stands as a call to repent and believe today, while mercy is held out. To those who belong to Christ, he stands as a call to endure—to hang on in faith, even when obedience is costly and the end is near.</p><br>

    <p>The man did not earn salvation by suffering, yet in faith he bore his cross and followed Jesus in the only way left to him: trusting the King beside him and committing himself wholly to Christ. Whether called to first belief or to steadfast perseverance, the Gospel presses us to the same response—to look to Christ alone and follow Him wherever He leads.</p><br>

    <h2>GUIDED READING</h2><br>

    <p><strong> “I Was There”</strong></p><br>

    <p><strong>Confession at the Cross</strong></p><br>

    <p><em>Stanza:</em></p>
    <p>
    I was there when dawn broke forth,<br>
    And judgment filled the air;<br>
    I did not pass as stranger by—<br>
    I stood among them there.
    </p><br>

    <p><em>Reflection:</em></p>
    <p>Begin here. The cross does not allow distance. We are not observers looking back at history, but sinners standing beneath judgment. To say “I was there” is already an act of honesty God grants by grace.</p><br>

    <p><em>Stanza:</em></p>
    <p>
    I was like those heavy-eyed,<br>
    Made dull and slow to heed;<br>
    My flesh refused the watchful call,<br>
    Too slothful for the need.
    </p><br>

    <p><em>Reflection:</em></p>
    <p>Here we confess not hostility, but neglect. How often has Christ called us to watch, pray, and remain alert—and we have chosen ease instead? Sloth is quiet, but deadly.</p><br>

    <p><em>Stanza:</em></p>
    <p>
    I was like the one warned in love,<br>
    My heart grown cold and hardened;<br>
    I heard His word, but harbored sin,<br>
    And walked into the garden.
    </p><br>

    <p><em>Reflection:</em></p>
    <p>This is willful sin—hearing Christ clearly and choosing another way. The tragedy is not ignorance, but resistance. Yet even seeing this rightly is itself mercy.</p><br>

    <p><em>Stanza:</em></p>
    <p>
    I was like those sworn to stay,<br>
    Yet scattered in the night;<br>
    When danger came and courage failed,<br>
    I fled beyond the light.
    </p><br>

    <p><em>Reflection:</em></p>
    <p>Promises are easy before pressure comes. This stanza names the gap between intention and faithfulness—a gap we all know.</p><br>

    <p><em>Stanza:</em></p>
    <p>
    I was like one who followed still,<br>
    But watched from far away;<br>
    I kept my place, I guarded self,<br>
    And would not fully stay.
    </p><br>

    <p><em>Reflection:</em></p>
    <p>Distance feels safe. We remain near enough to claim association, but far enough to avoid cost. The cross exposes this half-hearted following.</p><br>

    <p><em>Stanza:</em></p>
    <p>
    I was like one who said, “I do<br>
    Not know the Man,” in fear;<br>
    Before a servant’s searching voice<br>
    My courage disappeared.
    </p><br>

    <p><em>Reflection:</em></p>
    <p>Fear, not hatred, often drives denial. This stanza reminds us how fragile courage can be when faith is tested publicly.</p><br>

    <p><em>Stanza:</em></p>
    <p>
    I was like those who knew the Law,<br>
    Yet missed the Law made flesh;<br>
    I chose my peace, my standing safe,<br>
    And judged the Christ afresh.
    </p><br>

    <p><em>Reflection:</em></p>
    <p>Knowledge alone does not save. It is possible to handle Scripture and still miss the Savior to whom it points.</p><br>

    <p><em>Stanza:</em></p>
    <p>
    I was like the one who saw truth,<br>
    Yet washed his hands in fear;<br>
    I knew Him just, yet let Him die<br>
    To keep my power clear.
    </p><br>

    <p><em>Reflection:</em></p>
    <p>This stanza confronts moral compromise—the sin of choosing stability, reputation, or control over obedience.</p><br>

    <p><em>Stanza:</em></p>
    <p>
    I was like those in garb of scorn,<br>
    Who crowned His head with thorn;<br>
    I bowed in jest before the King<br>
    And mocked the One forlorn.
    </p><br>

    <p><em>Reflection:</em></p>
    <p>Mockery is not always loud. Sometimes it appears as sarcasm, dismissal, or refusal to worship Christ as He truly is.</p><br>

    <p><em>Stanza:</em></p>
    <p>
    I was like the royal one there,<br>
    Who sought to please my sight;<br>
    I mocked the truth and sought a trick,<br>
    And kept my throne in might.
    </p><br>

    <p><em>Reflection:</em></p>
    <p>Curiosity without repentance leaves us unchanged. We may want signs, experiences, or insight—without surrender.</p><br>

    <p><em>Stanza:</em></p>
    <p>
    I was like the one whose hands were raised,<br>
    Who drove the iron through;<br>
    I did my task with steady hands<br>
    As if it were not true.
    </p><br>

    <p><em>Reflection:</em></p>
    <p>Here we confess participation—doing what is required, following orders, claiming neutrality where none exists.</p><br>

    <p><em>Stanza:</em></p>
    <p>
    I was like those who passed Him by<br>
    And mocked His dying breath;<br>
    My voice was joined to scornful words<br>
    That followed Him in death.
    </p><br>

    <p><em>Reflection:</em></p>
    <p>Silence can also mock. Passing by the cross without response is itself a response.</p><br>

    <p><strong>Grace Revealed</strong></p><br>
    <p><em>Stanza:</em></p>
    <p>
    But mercy spoke where guilt stood fast,<br>
    And grace broke through the night.
    </p><br>

    <p><em>Reflection:</em></p>
    <p>This is the turning point. Sin has been named fully—and now grace enters, not because guilt softened, but because Christ bore it.</p><br>

    <p><strong>Eyes Opened</strong></p><br>
    <p><em>Stanza:</em></p>
    <p>
    Now let me be the one who stood<br>
    When earth and heaven shook;<br>
    Who saw the Son breathe out His life<br>
    And owned what death forsook.
    </p><br>

    <p><em>Reflection:</em></p>
    <p>Like the centurion, sight is given. Faith begins not with explanation, but with recognition.</p><br>

    <p><em>Response:</em></p>
    <p>Truly this was the Son of God.</p><br>

    <p><em>Stanza:</em></p>
    <p>
    Now let me be the one who turned<br>
    When hope was nearly gone;<br>
    Who saw a kingdom through the cross<br>
    And called on Christ alone.
    </p><br>

    <p><em>Reflection:</em></p>
    <p>Here is faith stripped of everything but trust. No merit, no time, no defense—only Christ.</p><br>

    <p><em>Response:</em></p>
    <p>
    Jesus, Lord, remember me,<br>
    When Your kingdom come.
    </p><br>

    <p><strong>Testimony and Perseverance</strong></p><br>
    <p><em>Stanza:</em></p>
    <p>
    Now I am made new by His grace,<br>
    Once lost, now reconciled;<br>
    I see the cross, I hear His voice,<br>
    And live as God’s own child.
    </p><br>

    <p><em>Reflection:</em></p>
    <p>This is not a vow, but testimony. New life flows from grace received, not effort supplied.</p><br>

    <p><strong>Final Confession</strong></p><br>
    <p><em>Closing:</em></p>
    <p>
    I see myself beneath the tree;<br>
    My hope is Christ who died for me.
    </p><br>

    <p><em>Reflection:</em></p>
    <p>This is the answer of the whole song, the devotional, and the Gospel itself. We end where we must always stand—beneath the cross, resting in Christ alone.</p><br>

      <h3>“Burden and Mercy”</h3>
      <span class="arrow">+</span>
    </button>

    <div class="devotion-body">
      <p><strong>Why “Burden and Mercy”?</strong></p> <br>
      <p>Every Christian life can be traced along two lines:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The burden we cannot remove</li>
        <li>The mercy we did not earn</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This song cycle walks through four witnesses—David, Hannah, Thomas, and finally the Cross—to teach one unified truth: What we cannot bear, Christ has borne.</p>
      <p>The refrain anchors everything: Justice is not ignored. It is fulfilled. Mercy is not sentimental. It is costly.</p><br>

      <h2>Guided Reading</h2><br>
      <p><strong>Scripture Anchors:</strong> Psalm 51; 1 Samuel 1; John 20:24–29; Isaiah 53; Romans 3:21–26</p><br>

      <h3>I. David — The Burden of Guilt</h3><br>

      <p><em>Stanza:</em><br>
      <p>
      The law of God exposed his sin,<br>
      No crown could shield his shame;<br>
      The prophet spoke, the burden fell,<br>
      And guilt stood justly named.
      </p><br>
      <p><em>Reflection:</em> <br>David’s story begins with exposure. The law reveals, it does not flatter. Mercy grants pardon, not because of David’s sorrow, but because Christ bore the debt.</p><br>

      <p><em>Stanza:</em><br>
      No tear could cleanse the debt he owed,<br>
      No vow could make him pure;<br>
      Yet mercy met the broken king<br>
      With pardon full and sure.
      </p><br>
      <p><em>Reflection:</em><br> Repentance is necessary, but cannot erase the debt. The burden reveals guilt; mercy gives justification.</p><br>

      <p><strong>Confessional Refrain:</strong><br> Burden and mercy meet at the cross…</p><br>

      <h3>II. Hannah — The Burden of Inability</h3><br>

      <p><em>Stanza:</em><br>
      <p>
      Her womb lay closed by sovereign will,<br>
      No strength could change her state;<br>
      The burden pressed her helpless cries,<br>
      Her hope deferred by fate.
      </p><br>
      <p><em>Reflection:</em><br> Hannah’s burden is inability. She cannot produce life herself; mercy gives what cannot be earned.</p><br>

      <p><em>Stanza:</em><br>
      <p>
      She poured her need before the Lord<br>
      With empty hands and plea;<br>
      The gift she gained was not her wage,<br>
      But grace alone, made free.
      </p><br>
      <p><em>Reflection:</em><br> Dependence on God is key. The burden exposes inability; mercy provides the gift freely.</p><br>

      <p><strong>Confessional Refrain:</strong><br> Her barrenness, like David’s guilt, finds ultimate resolution at the cross.</p><br>

      <h3>III. Thomas — The Burden of Unbelief</h3><br>

      <p><em>Stanza:</em><br>
      <p>
      He would not trust the spoken word,<br>
      Nor faith by witness take;<br>
      The burden bound his wounded heart<br>
      To proof he could not make.
      </p><br>
      <p><em>Reflection:</em> <br>Thomas’ burden is unbelief. Faith is not self-generated; Christ reveals Himself.</p><br>

      <p><em>Stanza:</em><br>
      <p>
      The risen Christ stood in his sight<br>
      And showed His wounded frame;<br>
      The doubt gave way when mercy spoke<br>
      Through scars that bore His name.
      </p><br>
      <p><em>Reflection:</em> <br>Christ’s revelation turns doubt into faith. The burden of unbelief yields to mercy.</p><br>

      <p><strong>Confessional Refrain:</strong><br> Thomas’ faith rests at the cross. Justice fulfilled. Mercy secured.</p><br>

      <h3>IV. The Cross — The Burden Fulfilled</h3><br>

      <p><em>Stanza:</em><br>
      <p>
      The burden laid on Adam’s race<br>
      No son of man could bear;<br>
      The law stood firm, the curse remained,<br>
      No guilt could be repaired.
      </p><br>
      <p><em>Reflection:</em> <br>Humanity’s burden is universal. Justice demands payment, and no one can fulfill it.</p><br>

      <p><em>Stanza:</em><br>
      <p>
      But Christ alone endured the weight<br>
      And satisfied the claim;<br>
      The cross bore all that justice sought,<br>
      And mercy crowned His name.
      </p><br>
      <p><em>Reflection:</em> <br>Christ fulfills justice and grants mercy. Burden and mercy meet at the cross.</p><br>

      <h3>Final Reflection</h3><br>
      <p>David shows guilt. Hannah shows helplessness. Thomas shows unbelief. The Cross shows Christ. The refrain gathers it all: The weight we could not bear or flee was laid on Christ, our victory. This is gospel proclamation, not moral instruction.</p><br>

    <h3>“Sent Not To Flee”</h3>
    <span class="arrow">+</span>
  </button>

  <div class="devotion-body">
    <p><strong>From Jonah to Jesus</strong></p><br>
    <p>Perhaps you see yourself in Jonah—running, resisting, shrinking back from the call of God. You may feel the storm around you, or the weight of guilt beneath you, as though the sea has already closed in. The message of Jonah is not that you must swim harder or pray better in order to be rescued. Jonah could not save himself from the deep.</p><br>
    <p>But there is One greater than Jonah—Jesus Christ—who did not flee from the will of God. He entered the storm willingly. He descended into death not for His own rebellion, but for yours. Where Jonah was preserved from judgment, Christ bore judgment fully.</p><br>
    <p>You do not need to rise from the depths before coming to Him. You come precisely because you cannot rise. Turn from your sin. Look to Christ. Trust not in your repentance as a work, but in His obedience as your righteousness. His sacrifice is sufficient. His mercy is real. Whoever comes to Him in faith will not be cast out.</p><br>

    <h2>Sent Not To Flee — A Stanza-by-Stanza</h2><br>
    <p><strong>Scripture Anchors:</strong> Jonah 1–4, Matthew 12:39–41, Romans 5:6–10</p><br>

    <h3>Stanza 1</h3>
    <p>The word of God to Jonah came:<br>
    “Arise, proclaim My name.”<br>
    Though sovereign mercy, rich and free,<br>
    He fled from God’s command.</p><br>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em><br>
    Jonah does not misunderstand God—he resists Him. This stanza reveals the doctrine of total depravity: even a prophet can recoil from sovereign mercy when it challenges his pride. The command is clear. The grace is real. Yet the heart flees. Sin is not ignorance but rebellion. Yet—even rebellion unfolds under divine sovereignty.</p><br>

    <h3>Stanza 2</h3>
    <p>He sank beneath the judgment’s hand,<br>
    Enclosed by death’s dark sea;<br>
    From depths below he cried aloud:<br>
    “Salvation’s from Thee.”</p><br>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em><br>
    The sea is not chaos; it is judgment under God’s hand. Jonah’s descent teaches that consequences are real. In the depths, doctrine becomes confession: “Salvation is the Lord’s.” Deliverance does not begin in human resolve but in divine mercy. Sovereignty is best learned when we can no longer save ourselves.</p><br>

    <h3>Chorus</h3>
    <p>Salvation belongs to God,<br>
    His mercy stands secure;<br>
    The greater Sign has come in Christ,<br>
    Our hope and life made sure.</p><br>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em><br>
    Salvation is not fragile. It does not depend on our consistency, strength, or emotional state. It belongs to God. And because it belongs to God, it is secure.</p><br>

    <h3>Stanza 3</h3>
    <p>Yet Jonah was a sign alone,<br>
    A shadow briefly shown;<br>
    A greater One has come at last,<br>
    God’s true and faithful Son.</p><br>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em><br>
    Jonah is not the hero. He is a shadow. The Old Testament is preparation. Every prophet points forward. Christ is the faithful Son. Where Jonah resisted, Christ obeyed.</p><br>

    <h3>Stanza 4</h3>
    <p>The Son descended—not for sin,<br>
    But bore our guilt and shame;<br>
    He drank the cup the Father gave<br>
    And bore the sinner’s blame.</p><br>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em><br>
    Jonah suffers for his own rebellion. Christ suffers for ours. This stanza confesses penal substitution—the heart of the gospel. Christ absorbs judgment. The gospel is not God ignoring sin, but God judging sin in His Son.</p><br>

    <h3>Chorus</h3>
    <p>Salvation belongs to God…</p><br>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em><br>
    Salvation belongs to God because Christ has satisfied justice. Mercy is not sentimental. It is secured by blood.</p><br>

    <h3>Stanza 5</h3>
    <p>Three days He lay in death’s cold hold,<br>
    Then rose in conquering might;<br>
    The grave was torn, the curse undone,<br>
    The dead restored to life.</p><br>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em><br>
    Jonah emerges from a fish. Christ emerges from death itself. Resurrection is historical, bodily, triumphant. Without it, there is no hope. With it, death has lost its claim.</p><br>

    <h3>Stanza 6</h3>
    <p>Jonah was spared by sovereign grace;<br>
    The Son was crushed instead.<br>
    The prophet lived; the Savior died<br>
    And bore our guilt and dread.</p><br>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em><br>
    This is the great exchange. Jonah lives because judgment stops. Christ dies because judgment falls. Grace is not God relaxing standards—it is God satisfying them in Christ. Salvation is secure.</p><br>

    <h3>Final Chorus</h3>
    <p>Salvation belongs to God,<br>
    His mercy stands secure;<br>
    The greater Sign has come in Christ,<br>
    Forever strong and sure.</p><br>

    <h3>Final Meditation</h3>
    <p>Why does this matter?<br>
    Our hope cannot rest in:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; Our repentance<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; Our obedience<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; Our consistency<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; Our spiritual maturity<br>
    It rests in Christ alone. Jonah points. Christ saves. Salvation belongs to God and cannot be undone by man.</p><br>

    <h3>The Scepter and the Cross</h3>
    <span class="arrow">+</span>
  </button>

  <div class="devotion-body">
    <p><strong>The Scepter and the Cross</strong></p><br>
    <p>Imagine standing before a throne where justice is perfect and nothing hidden remains concealed. No argument can excuse you. No record can clear you. The law stands, and it is righteous.</p><br>
    <p>Yet the message of the cross is not that mercy ignores justice. It is that justice has been satisfied. Jesus Christ did not approach the throne hoping for favor—He bore the penalty that stood against His people. The cross is the place where judgment fell, so that mercy might be given without compromise.</p><br>
    <p>You do not stand waiting to see if God will extend His scepter. In Christ, the way has already been opened. The invitation now is not uncertain. It is sincere. Draw near, not in presumption, but in faith. Lay down every attempt to justify yourself. Receive what Christ has secured. In Him, access is granted. In Him, grace is sure.</p><br>

    <h2>The Scepter and the Cross — A Stanza-by-Stanza</h2><br>
    <p><strong>Scripture Anchors:</strong> Esther 5:1–2; Hebrews 7:25; Romans 8:34; 2 Corinthians 5:21</p><br>

    <h3>Stanza 1</h3>
    <p>In foreign courts, beneath a crown…<br>
    Yet still preserved by unseen hand.</p><br>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em><br>
    The exile reminds us that the church often lives under earthly powers not its own. Yet the covenant of grace does not expire in foreign lands. God preserves His people not because circumstances are favorable, but because His decree is sure. Even when worship is restricted and influence seems small, the Lord governs history for His church. The preservation of Israel in Persia was not luck—it was promise.</p><br>

    <h3>Stanza 2</h3>
    <p>His name unspoken on the page…<br>
    Was drawn by Him who sovereign led.</p><br>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em><br>
    The book of Esther never mentions God by name. Yet His providence saturates every scene. Sleepless kings, remembered records, delayed banquets—none are accidental. This stanza confesses meticulous sovereignty. God governs both great empires and quiet details. His hidden hand is not weaker than His revealed power; it is simply quieter.</p><br>

    <h3>Stanza 3</h3>
    <p>A maiden raised to royal place…<br>
    A throne before her—ruled by God alone.</p><br>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em><br>
    Esther’s elevation was not self-made. She was placed in position by divine appointment. The throne of Persia appeared supreme—but above it stood the throne of heaven. This guards us from political despair and political idolatry alike. Kings rule—but only under God.</p><br>

    <h3>Stanza 4</h3>
    <p>A lawful word of death was sealed…<br>
    No hand but God’s could yet secure.</p><br>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em><br>
    The decree against the Jews was legal and binding. The law stood against them. This reflects a deeper spiritual reality: the law of God rightly condemns sinners. Deliverance does not come by ignoring the law. It comes through God’s provision within His justice.</p><br>

    <h3>Stanza 5</h3>
    <p>She fasted, prayed, then drew near still…<br>
    My life rests wholly in His hand.</p><br>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em><br>
    Esther acts responsibly within God’s sovereignty. She fasts. She prays. She obeys. Providence never removes duty. Her courage is real—but it is rooted in trust, not self-confidence. She entrusts her life to God’s will. OPC emphasis: God’s decree establishes, not eliminates, human responsibility.</p><br>

    <h3>Stanza 6</h3>
    <p>The scepter rose, the verdict turned…<br>
    The Lord proved faithful over all.</p><br>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em><br>
    Judgment is reversed. The enemy falls. Yet notice: God does not deny justice—He exposes evil and overturns it righteously. The gallows built for Mordecai becomes Haman’s end. Evil collapses under its own pride. This is providential justice, not poetic coincidence.</p><br>

    <h3>Stanza 7</h3>
    <p>In later days, a greater came…<br>
    But chosen love that walked through death.</p><br>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em><br>
    Here the shadow gives way to substance. Esther risked death. Christ embraced it. Esther interceded before a human throne. Christ mediates before the throne of heaven. This is redemptive-historical fulfillment. The preservation of Israel in Esther ensures the coming of the Messiah.</p><br>

    <h3>Stanza 8</h3>
    <p>Jesus Christ did not plead where mercy might…<br>
    He stood condemned that life He’d give.</p><br>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em><br>
    This is the heart of the gospel. Christ does not ask the Father to overlook justice. He satisfies it. He bears the curse of the law. Mercy is not sentimental—it is substitutionary. Where Esther hoped to live, Christ chose to die. Where she was spared, He was struck. And because He bore condemnation, believers stand justified.</p><br>

    <h3>Final Stanza</h3>
    <p>The throne of grace stands open wide…<br>
    For such a time, He came to bless.</p><br>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em><br>
    The hidden providence of Esther now gives way to revealed redemption in Christ. The throne that once required fearful approach is now called the throne of grace (Hebrews 4:16). Believers draw near—not because risk is removed—but because wrath has been satisfied. The scepter extended to Esther points forward to the cross where mercy is secured forever.</p><br>

    <h3>Burden — The Silence of the Inner Court</h3>
    <p>Esther stepped into a room where silence could mean death.<br>
    “On the third day Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the palace…” — Esther 5:1</p><br>
    <p>The law was clear: no one approached the king uninvited. Her courage was real, but so was the danger. If the golden scepter was not extended, her life would end. She did not go for herself alone. She carried the lives of her people. Every step forward was an act of intercession. And yet—even in her bravery—Esther entered uncertain. She hoped for mercy. She depended on favor. She waited for the scepter.</p><br>
    <p>“When he saw Queen Esther standing in the court, he was pleased with her and held out to her the gold scepter…” — Esther 5:2<br>
    The scepter was raised. She lived. But her story leaves us with a deeper burden. We do not stand before an earthly throne. We stand before a holy God. “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” — Romans 3:23. God is just. Sin must be answered.</p><br>

    <h3>Mercy — A Greater Throne</h3>
    <p>Now consider Christ. He does not enter the presence of the Father uncertain of the outcome. He does not hope justice will be relaxed. He goes knowing exactly what righteousness requires. Esther risked death and received life. Christ embraced death and gave life. There is no golden scepter lifted to spare Him. There is a cross lifted to receive Him.</p><br>
    <p>“God made him who had no sin to be sin for us…” — 2 Corinthians 5:21<br>
    The Father does not suspend justice. The Son satisfies it. Esther’s mediation preserved both her and her people. Christ’s mediation costs Him His life so that His people may live. And because He died and rose again, He now stands forever in the Father’s presence: “Christ Jesus… is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us.” — Romans 8:34. “Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them.” — Hebrews 7:25. The greater Mediator has entered.</p><br>

    <h3>Assurance — Union with Christ</h3>
    <p>How does His finished work become ours? Not by effort. Not by improvement. Not by religious striving. “For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God.” — Ephesians 2:8. Because we are united to Christ by faith, His finished work is counted as ours.</p><br>
    <p>In that union: His obedience is our righteousness. His death is our judgment borne. His resurrection is our new life. We do not stand before God in our courage, like Esther. We stand in Christ Himself. “Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.” — Romans 5:1. The Father does not merely see our plea. He sees His Son. And because we are joined to the Son by faith alone, the verdict declared over Him—“Righteous”—is declared over us. This is why the scepter has already been raised.</p><br>

    <h3>Call — Rest and Courage</h3>
    <p>The scepter teaches us courage. The cross teaches us peace. Union with Christ gives us assurance. If you see your sin today, do not hide from it. “But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” — Romans 5:8. Turn from your sin. Rest in Christ alone. “Whoever comes to me I will never drive away.” — John 6:37.</p><br>
    <p>Because Christ has gone before the Father for His people: Your sin is answered. Your judgment is borne. Your righteousness is secured. Your access is certain. You no longer step forward hoping for mercy. You step forward resting in mercy already given in Christ. And like Esther, you are now sent—not to earn deliverance—but to live boldly because deliverance is sure.</p><br>

    <h3>Only Grace</h3>
    <span class="arrow">+</span>
  </button>

  <div class="devotion-body">
    <p><strong>Only Grace</strong></p><br>
    <p>The woman who put her tools away. Based on Gospel of Luke 7:36–50</p><br>

    <h3>Seeing the Woman Clearly</h3>
    <p>The woman who comes to Jesus in Luke 7 does not speak a word. She brings no defense, no explanation, no argument for her worthiness. Her repentance is not delivered in sentences, but in actions.</p><br>
    <p>She comes carrying the last tool of her former life — a jar that represents both her livelihood and her shame. When she breaks it, she is not making a dramatic gesture for effect. She is cutting off retreat. She is confessing, without words, that this life cannot continue if she belongs to Him.</p><br>
    <p>What is striking is that Jesus does not require a rehearsed confession or promise of reform before declaring her forgiven. He does not demand that she prove herself. He does not question the sincerity of her tears.</p><br>
    <p>Instead, He interprets her actions for the room: “She loved much, because she was forgiven much.” Forgiveness does not follow her love — it produces it. Repentance does not purchase grace — it flows from grace. Her silence is not emptiness. It is faith at rest.</p><br>

    <h3>Seeing Ourselves Honestly</h3>
    <p>Most of us will never carry an alabaster jar into a Pharisee’s house. But every one of us carries something we rely on to justify ourselves. We all have our own “tools”:<br>
      • habits we return to when we feel exposed<br>
      • reputations we polish to hide guilt<br>
      • distractions we use to avoid stillness<br>
      • sins that once helped us survive, but now keep us from peace</p><br>
    <p>Like this woman, we often know these things are destroying us — and yet they feel safer than letting ourselves fall helplessly at Christ’s feet. Grace confronts us here, gently but firmly: What would it mean for you to stop negotiating with Jesus? What would it look like to stop explaining yourself? What would it cost you to put your tools down?</p><br>
    <p>The woman does not come asking Jesus to bless her life as it is. She comes because she knows that if He does not keep her, she will not be kept. That is the posture of saving faith.</p><br>

    <h3>A Gospel Call — Only Grace Can Keep Us</h3>
    <p>This passage does not invite us to admire the woman from a distance. It invites us to recognize ourselves beside her. Some of us carry loud sins. Some of us carry respectable ones. Some of us carry shame we have never named, even to ourselves.</p><br>
    <p>Christ does not ask us to clean ourselves before we come. He asks us to come — and to come honestly. The same Jesus who released her from her sins still speaks with authority today. He still forgives. He still receives faith, however trembling. He still sends sinners away in peace.</p><br>
    <p>The call of the gospel is not: “Fix yourself and then approach.” It is: “Come, because forgiveness has already been accomplished in Me.” If you find yourself weary, exposed, or unable to hold yourself together — that is not a reason to stay away. It is the very reason to come.</p><br>
    <p>Like the woman, we bring nothing but our need. Like the woman, we lay ourselves at His feet. And like the woman, we trust that the One who forgives sins is also the One who keeps those He has forgiven. Only grace can keep us.</p><br>

    <h2>Only Grace — A Stanza-by-Stanza</h2><br>
    <p><strong>Scripture Anchor:</strong> Luke 7:36-50</p><br>

    <h3>Stanza 1</h3>
    <p>“She had learned her trade the way others learned— not from love, but from need.”</p><br>
    <p><em>Devotional Reflection:</em><br>
    This opening does not excuse sin — but it explains bondage. Scripture never denies guilt, yet it is honest about how sin entangles us. The woman’s life is shaped by necessity, not delight. Her choices were real, and her guilt is real — but so is the broken world that pressed her into survival. Here we learn something crucial for the gospel call: many of the sins we cling to did not begin as pleasures, but as shelters. Before grace, we often sin to live. After grace, we learn that sin can no longer keep us alive.</p><br>

    <h3>Stanza 2</h3>
    <p>“She knew what bought a meal… a city that counted her sin but never counted her hunger.”</p><br>
    <p><em>Devotional Reflection:</em><br>
    This stanza exposes the cruelty of self-righteous judgment. The city knows her reputation but not her story. It is quick to condemn and slow to consider mercy. This prepares us to see the contrast between Simon and Jesus. Simon counts sins. Jesus counts debt — and then cancels it. Here the song quietly asks us: Are we more practiced at identifying sin than at extending grace?</p><br>

    <h3>Stanza 3</h3>
    <p>“Like a craftsman with a belt of tools… Perfume. Touch. Silence. Shame.”</p><br>
    <p><em>Devotional Reflection:</em><br>
    This is the heart of the metaphor. Her “tools” are not neutral objects — they are means of survival that now enslave her. They are how she copes, how she earns, how she hides. Each of us has tools like this:<br>
      • ways of managing guilt<br>
      • ways of numbing shame<br>
      • ways of controlling how others see us</p><br>
    <p>The gospel does not begin by prying these tools from our hands. It begins by showing us Who is worth dropping them for.</p><br>

    <h3>Stanza 4</h3>
    <p>“And then she heard His name.”</p><br>
    <p><em>Devotional Reflection:</em><br>
    Nothing changes until Christ enters the story. She does not hear a program. She does not hear a rule. She hears a person — one who speaks forgiveness as though He owns it. Faith is not generated by introspection. It is awakened by hearing the word about Christ. The woman comes because the word about Jesus has already reached her. So it is with us: faith begins not with effort, but with hearing.</p><br>

    <h3>Stanza 5</h3>
    <p>“She did not come to negotiate… She came undone.”</p><br>
    <p><em>Devotional Reflection:</em><br>
    This is repentance stripped of performance. She brings no vows. She offers no reform plan. She does not ask Jesus to bless her life as it is. She comes because she has reached the end of herself. This is the posture of saving faith — not strength, but surrender. Not bargaining, but collapse.</p><br>

    <h3>Stanza 6</h3>
    <p>“The jar in her hands was not an offering to purchase mercy…”</p><br>
    <p><em>Devotional Reflection:</em><br>
    Here the song guards the gospel carefully. The jar is not payment. It is not a bribe. It is the last tool of a life she knows cannot continue. True repentance always costs something — but it never earns anything. She breaks the jar because forgiveness has already found her, not because she hopes it might.</p><br>

    <h3>Stanza 7</h3>
    <p>“Tears came first… She had washed many feet before— but never like this.”</p><br>
    <p><em>Devotional Reflection:</em><br>
    The same outward actions now mean something entirely different. What once served sin now serves love. What once brought shame now expresses humility. Grace does not merely stop sinful behavior — it reclaims the body, the will, the affections. Sanctification is not erasure. It is redemption.</p><br>

    <h3>Stanza 8</h3>
    <p>“Every movement said what her mouth could not.”</p><br>
    <p><em>Devotional Reflection:</em><br>
    This is faith embodied. She does not speak because she does not need to. Her silence is not emptiness — it is trust. She places herself entirely at Christ’s feet, knowing that if He does not keep her, she will not be kept. This is where we see ourselves. Saving faith is not eloquent. It is dependent.</p><br>

    <h3>Stanza 9</h3>
    <p>“Simon counted her sins. She counted His mercy.”</p><br>
    <p><em>Devotional Reflection:</em><br>
    Here the song divides the room — and the heart. Simon represents religion without grace. The woman represents grace without pretense. One counts sin to protect his standing. The other counts mercy because she has none of her own. Which are we counting?</p><br>

    <h3>Stanza 10</h3>
    <p>“But forgiveness has already found her.”</p><br>
    <p><em>Devotional Reflection:</em><br>
    This line anchors everything. Forgiveness is not the result of her actions. It is the reason for them. Grace does not wait for completion. It creates it.</p><br>

    <h3>Stanza 11</h3>
    <p>“He released her from her sins… and sent her away—not in fear, but in peace.”</p><br>
    <p><em>Devotional Reflection:</em><br>
    Jesus does what only God can do. He declares forgiveness. He names faith as the instrument. He sends her away reconciled. Peace is not a feeling here — it is a verdict.</p><br>

    <h3>Final Gospel Call — Seeing Ourselves at His Feet</h3>
    <p>This song does not ask us to admire the woman. It asks us to recognize ourselves beside her. Each of us has tools we use to survive shame. Each of us knows what it is to hide, to manage, to perform. The gospel does not call us to improve those tools. It calls us to lay them down.</p><br>
    <p>Christ does not say, “Fix yourself and then come.” He says, “Come — and I will keep you by My grace.” Like the woman, we bring nothing but our need. Like the woman, we trust ourselves to His mercy. And like the woman, we are sent away in peace — not because we are strong, but because grace alone is strong enough to keep us.</p><br>
